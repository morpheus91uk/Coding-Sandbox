                    Craggy Island has been inhabited, on and off, for approximately 8500 years. Situated just off the Northern
                    Coast of Ireland, a few miles off shore, the island was settled numerous times, by many different peoples.
                    <br><br>
                    The island was originally named <em>Cragoi Island</em>, according to the earliest remaining texts and surviving
                    references to the island, that have survived through the ages. The islands first inhabitants remain a complete mystery.
                    Extensive archaeological excavations are constantly being conducted on the island, in an effort to discover who
                    was truly the first People to colonize the island. However, every year, we are uncovering new information that may
                    just lead to that ultimate discovery.
                    <br><br>
                    All records prior to the Pictish Invasion in the year 870AD have been so far, lost to time. The only remaining
                    texts that mention the Island's inhabitants before this date, are second or third-hand accounts, from less than 
                    100% reliable sources. As such, until further discoveries come to light, we only have a solid foundation of knowledge
                    regarding the islands history from around 870AD onwards.

                    The <strong>Picts</strong> were a group of peoples who lived in Britain, North of the
                    Forth-Clyde isthmus in the Pre-Viking era, in the Early Middle Ages. The term <em>"Pict"</em>
                    dates all the way back to end of the third century. It's earliest was found in Roman texts
                    that date all the way back to around 280AD. The term was used to describe the <em>unromanised</em>
                    people who lived in the North of Britain.
                    <br><br>
                    Several clans of the Picts invaded and colonized Cragoi Island in the year 869AD. The invasion
                    was documented in several proflic texts from the era. Whilst the details of which clans, where
                    the invasion exactly occured, and from where the Picts launched their ships, differs in each account.
                    <br><br>
                    What remains consistant across the various accounts however, was that it was a force made up of a
                    coalition of Pictish clans, and, that the inhabitants of the island were completely wiped out in
                    the invasion, leaving nothing of themselves behind.

                    After swiftly cleansing the island of its original occupants, the Picts very quickly colonized the entire island. 
                    They tore down and destroyed the various settlements that were already in place, to build their own settlements in
                    their place.
                    <br><br>
                    The Picts built a large fortress atop one of the Cliffs that overlooked the channel that stretch between the island
                    and the mainland. From here they successfully defended the island from numerous invaders for nearly 160 years!
                    <br><br>
                    However, as the Pictish peoples prospered across the North of the British Isles, they intermingled and eventually 
                    merged with the <em>DÃ¡l Riata</em>, a Gaelic people who encompassed the Western Seaboard of Scotland. The newly combined 
                    tribe of peoples became the Gaelic <em>Kingdom of Alba</em>.

                    <strong>The very first Lyre Festival</strong> was said to have taken place in the year 1043. The newly
                    formed Gaelic Kingdom of Alba had retained the Cragoi Island as part of its territory. Turning it into 
                    a small but bustling port town, that lay between the mainland of Ireland and the North of British main 
                    land.
                    <br><br>
                    After a few prosperous years as a port town, Cragoi Island began attracting more people, including
                    a sect of politically influential Druids. These druids primarly worshipped the Pagan deities the <em>Tuatha De Danann</em>,
                    an ancient, supernatural race, descended from Pre-Christian Gaelic Ireland Deities.
                    <br><br>
                    In worship of the deities, every four years, the Druids would hold a ritual festival. This festival was primarily
                    about making sacrifices and honouring the Gods. However, to do that this festival needed to be
                    a huge celebration of the Gods, lasting for four days and nights. People would come from across the entire Kingdom,
                    to gather on Cragoi Island, and feast and celebrate with traditional music played on a Lyre.

                    For almost 250 years, the Lyre Festival was held every four years like clockwork, in celebration of the Gods.
                    However, in the year 1285, <em>Alexander III</em>, King of the Scots and the Kingdom of Alba, died. The very next
                    year, the English King <em>Edward I</em>, invaded. 
                    <br><br>
                    The brutal war between the Kingdoms ripped through the land for decades, and became known as the First War of 
                    Scottish Independance. During the next century or so, Christianity would begin to drive out Paganism across the
                    Brittish Isles, and eventually this would include Cragoi Island.  
                    <br><br>
                    In the year 1328, when the war finally ended, Cragoi Island was renamed Craggy Island by the Christian Church, as a
                    slight against any remaining pagans on the island. Changing the name of the island from its ancestral Cragoi, infuriated
                    the locals, and a breif but bloody war was then fought.

                    <strong>The Cragoi War</strong> was fought over a period of only 11 days, in the year 1038. The remaining settlements
                    of pagans, who lived on Cragoi Island, were outraged at the Churches audacity surrounding the name change. Scotland had
                    managed to retain its independence from England, but Ireland had fallen to English rule. This included the surrounding islands,
                    Cragoi included. 
                    <br><br>
                    After conceding to the English rule, the Church decided to build a Monastery on the island, to cement Christianity as the 
                    dominant religion on the island. This meant doing away with the sacred site of the Lyre Festival. The locals refused, and 
                    declared war on the Church, despite being massively outnumbered.
                    <br><br>
                    The Cragoi people wrongly thought that their knowledge of the cliffs that surrounded the island, would be enough to stave off any
                    Christian attacks. However, the Church took the opportunity to make an example of the Cragoi peoples. They sent
                    a force large enough to launch a crusade on the Holy Land, agaisnt the tiny island of Cragoi. The Cragoi managed to prevent
                    any Christian ships from landing on the island for a week and a half, through the use of some cleverly position trebuchets. However
                    on the eve of the 10th day of the war, a single Christian soldier had managed to make it ashore undeteced. He allued the Cragoi
                    peoples, who ever naturally exhausted after a week and half of fighting a force a thousand times their own size. 
                    <br><br>
                    The lone soldier managed to disable one of the key trebuchet defences, allowing for the first Christian ships to make landfall on
                    the island. Within a matter of hours, the Christian soldiers had swept across the tiny island and decimated 95% of the Pagan Cragoi.
                    The few who remained, survived only because they cut the rope bridge that connected to thier cliff, with no way to get to them, the
                    Christian soldiers decided to let them live, to spread word of what had happened here. In honour of their survival, the remaining Cragoi
                    rebuilt the bridge, and it still stands today.

                    Despite the fact that 95% of the Pagan population of the newly named Craggy Island were now dead, when it became
                    time for the next Lyre Festival to begin, the island was swamped with visitors who hadn't heard of the massacre that 
                    took place.  
                    <br><br>
                    Thousands of people descended on the island, expecting to attend a long weekend of celebration. Although it was primarily
                    a Pagan celebration, over the centuries, it had grown in popularity. Most of the people who arrived for the festival were
                    Christian now, but the Churck could not allow a Pagan festival to take place. It would be an afront to God.
                    <br><br>
                    So that year, instead of Celebrating the ancient race of deities known as the <em>Tuatha De Danaan</em>, the Church 
                    appropriated the festival, turning into a celebration of God, and Christianity instead. The Festival continued, much as it
                    had done so previously, only now, it involved more Christian friendly themes.

                    As centuries went by, the religous aspects of the festival slowly declined over the years, until they were eventually
                    entirely replaced and forgotten about. The Lyre Festival had become the Lyre Music Festival, a celebration of all 
                    things music, for all to enjoy.
                    <br><br>
                    Today the Lyre Music Festival is bigger than ever, with the last event being attended by over 20,000 music fans!
